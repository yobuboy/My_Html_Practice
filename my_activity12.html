        <h1>Language Attribute</h1>
        <p>You should always include the lang attribute inside the html tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.</p>
        <p>Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.</p>
